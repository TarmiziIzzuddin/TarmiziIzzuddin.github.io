<div style="text-align: justify">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of study concerns on allowing machines to imitate human's thinking or behaviour. By applying AI techniques, machines would be able to solve complex engineering problems such as predicting numbers of defect products in factory, optimizing a water tank system, classifying patients based on symptoms of a disease and etc. In this course students will be exposed to the popular subtopics in ai which includes machine learning, fuzzy logic, neural network and deep learning. Students will be exposed towards the concept of ai and its implementation methods in mechatronics/electrical engineering system using appropriate tools such as simulink/matlab, python, scikit-learn, tensorflow and other appropriate tools.</div>
